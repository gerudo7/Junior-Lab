    "* Plasmas are ionized gases characterized by macroscopic parameters that include temperatures, densities, and pressure. The parameters specify  statistical distributions of the positions and velocities of the particles - electrons, ions, and neutral atoms & molecules - that make up the plasma. Under some circumstances, the parameters can be different for the different particle species so that, for example, the electron temperature can be much different than the temperatures of ions and neutrals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, the plasma of interest is the \"positive column\" of a glow discharge maintained in a long tube by a fairly high DC voltage ($\\sim$ 1 kV) and small current ($\\sim$ a few mA). The tube is placed in series with a fixed ballast resistor that helps select the actual operating current. The discharge has a complex structure, especially near the negative cathode. However, the long uniformly glowing region that extends almost up to the anode is called the positive column and will be seen to have fairly uniform characteristics. In fact, the positive column is *an open non-equilibrium system* sustained by a constant input of energy (due to work done by the electric field on mobile charges) and by a steady flow of current passing through the region. Our goal in this write-up is to create a first model of the postive column plasma in order to make initial estimates of the parameters that we intend to measure.\n",

To do this, we introduce the concept of a distribution function $f(x,y,z,\\text{v}_x,\\text{v}_y,\\text{v}_z)$. The value $f(x,y,z,\\text{v}_x,\\text{v}_y,\\text{v}_z)dxdydzd\\text{v}_xd\\text{v}_yd\\text{v}_z$ describes how many molecules have positions and velocities contained within the 6-dimensional domain\n",

We will see below that when we deal with non-equilibrium conditions for a plasma, the statistical interpretation of temperature can still be used even though the thermodynamic interpretation is not strictly valid for a non-equilibrium system. While the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution can be proven to be (by far) the most likely distribution for a gas in equilibrium, it may only be an approximate model for particles in a non-equilibrium plasma.\n",

Out of this analysis will come predictions of the electron temperature, local electric field strength, and electron/ion densities."
