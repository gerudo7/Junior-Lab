Junior Lab

This is a repository of my classwork.
Feel free to use any code I (with the help of professors and classmates) have written.
This exists primarily for my own use.
Anything that is not code can be cited, but you may not present it as your own.

To anyone who found this to help with their own labs - good luck!
